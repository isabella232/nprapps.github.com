Hey! You! With the weird talent!

We have two internships on the Visuals team. One is for [photo editing](/2016/04/08/fall-photo-internship.html), the other, well, it's weird.

We've had journalists who are learning to code, programmers who are learning about journalism, designers who love graphics, designers who love UX, reporters who love data, and illustrators who make beautiful things!

Does any of this sound like you? Please join our team! You'll learn a ton and it'll be fun.
