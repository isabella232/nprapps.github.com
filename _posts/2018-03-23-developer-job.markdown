## Overview

*A thriving, mission-driven multimedia organization, NPR produces award-winning news, information, and music programming in partnership with hundreds of independent public radio stations across the nation. NPR listeners value information, creativity, curiosity, and social responsibility – our employees do too. We are innovators and leaders in diverse fields, from journalism and digital media to product design and software engineering.

Our team is composed of developers, designers, photo and video journalists. You will have to work quickly in a dynamic environment. Making software on deadlines is difficult -- there's no room for cruft and little margin for error. You will encounter new problems every day and will wear many hats, as a data wrangler, web developer, innovator, architect, etc. We are always open to new tools and teammates who bring experience with different technologies and disciplines.

## We're looking for someone who can...

* Translate editorial goals into sustainable applications and infrastructure.

* Maintain up-to-date technical documentation using consistent and reusable practices.

* Experience with Python and familiarity with Python web frameworks such as Flask or Django and Fabric.
* Familiarity with Amazon Web Services and provisioning AWS resources using the console, CLI and API.

* Capacity to select the appropriate Javascript architecture given specific project needs.
* Experience developing software projects using the Git version control system.
* Fluency in JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3, including media queries and responsive web design techniques.
