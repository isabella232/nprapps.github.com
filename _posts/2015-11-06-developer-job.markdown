![The NPR Visuals team](/img/posts/selfie.jpg)

Love to code?

Want to use your skills to make the world a better place?

We're a crew of visual journalists (developers, designers, photojournalists...lots of things) in the newsroom at NPR headquarters in sunny Washington, DC. We make [charts and maps](http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/10/20/448407788/where-the-girls-are-and-aren-t-15girls), we [make and edit pictures and video](http://www.npr.org/2015/11/05/453239276/in-the-amazons-fire-season-you-either-burn-or-you-starve), we [help reporters with data](http://www.npr.org/2014/09/02/342494225/mraps-and-bayonets-what-we-know-about-the-pentagons-1033-program), and we create all sorts of [web-native visual stories](http://apps.npr.org/lookatthis/posts/yemen/) and weird [data-driven websites](http://earbud.fm/).

(And yeah, sometimes it's strange to be a visuals team at a radio organization. But there’s this special thing about audio. It’s intimate, it’s personal. Well, visual storytelling is really similar. Its power is innate. Humans invented writing &mdash; visual and audio storytelling are built in, deep in our primordial lizard brains. So, anyway, yeah, we fit right in.)

Pictures and graphics are little empathy machines. And that's our mission. To create empathy. **To make people care.**

It's important work, and great fun.

And we'd love it if you'd join us.

### We believe strongly that...
* We must put our audience's needs first
* The right way to resolve an argument is with [evidence](http://blog.apps.npr.org/2015/02/26/multivariate-testing.html)
* It's our duty to serve the public, so we [give away our data](http://www.npr.org/2014/09/02/342494225/mraps-and-bayonets-what-we-know-about-the-pentagons-1033-program) and [write about our work](http://blog.apps.npr.org/2015/02/26/multivariate-testing.html)

### You must have…
* Experience making things for the web (We've got [ways we like](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/all-about-dailygraphics/) [to do things](http://blog.apps.npr.org/2013/02/14/app-template-redux.html), but we love to meet folks with new ideas and talents!)
* Attention to detail and love for making things
* A genuine and friendly disposition

(What "developer" exactly means for this position is pretty flexible. You might do lots of front-end stuff like graphics, or data crunching, or other stuff. We'd love to hear from people with many different skills and interests!)

### Bonus points for…
* Deep knowledge of Javascript and programming performant web software
* Proven experience and a passion for running open-source projects
* A background in data journalism and/or news graphics

### Allow me to persuade you
The newsroom is a crucible. We work on tight schedules with hard deadlines. That may sound stressful, but check this out: With every project we learn from our mistakes and refine our methods. It’s a fast-moving, volatile environment that drives you to be better at what you do, every day. It's awesome. Job perks include...

* Live music at the [Tiny Desk](http://www.npr.org/series/tiny-desk-concerts/)
* All the tote bags you can eat
* A sense of purpose

## Know somebody who'd love this job?

Maybe it's you?
