NPR Visuals is looking for a news apps designer to join our team in Washington, D.C., on a contract basis. The length of the contract term is flexible — ideally starting as soon as possible and going through the end of 2018. We prefer a candidate who will work in our Washington, D.C., office, but we will consider remote work arrangements. **Apply by Friday, Sept. 14.**

----------

## What You Will Do

You will work on information graphics, data visualizations and special story presentations, working in close collaboration with reporters and editors in our newsroom. The ideal candidate will have strong, demonstrable experience using [HTML, CSS, front-end JS, and D3.js](https://github.com/nprapps/dailygraphics) to build visual representations of data that work well on both desktop and mobile.

----------

## What We're Looking For In A Teammate

**You have strong news judgement and a sense for what makes a good visual story that serves the audience.** Moreover, you pay close attention to detail and understand the importance of nuance, precision and ethics. The ideal candidate will have experience working in a newsroom.

**You are a team player.** You’re willing to collaborate in an open environment, working with people across the newsroom with a variety of skillsets and areas of expertise. You can explain and defend your ideas, and you are open to critique and alternative approaches. When offering feedback to colleagues, you can articulate story, design and code suggestions in a helpful and supportive way.

**You have a diverse skillset.** In addition to the core skills required to do your job, you might also have expertise in areas like user experience design, data analysis, cartography or working with AP election results.

**You can produce quality work on deadline.** We turn around projects on time scales that run from a couple hours to a couple weeks to a couple months. You need to be able to assess what approaches will best serve a given story, what work realistically can be executed in the time available and then execute that work on time.

**You consider yourself a problem solver.** You can dive into existing projects to provide maintenance and support. You can face unknown issues in unknown projects methodically, debugging until you find the cause of the issue, and implementing the best possible solution once diagnosed.
