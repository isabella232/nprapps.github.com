Love photography?

Obsessed with the web?

Do you find [magic in the mundane](http://www.npr.org/2014/01/29/266757131/welcome-to-oil-country-a-modern-day-gold-rush-in-north-dakota)?

The visuals team is looking for a **News Picture Editor** to work with us at NPR headquarters in Washington, DC. It's a new and important role, fit for an experienced editor. You’ll rethink our photographic approach to daily news. You’ll work on stories that matter, at a place people love. You’ll invent new ways to see stories and teach them to our newsroom.

You'll work fast and hard. You'll have a damned good time.

## We believe strongly in...
- Putting our audience first
- Integrity, accuracy and originality
- [Cross-disciplinary collaboration](http://source.opennews.org/en-US/learning/how-and-why-cross-disciplinary-collaboration-rocks/)
- Making things that are *of* the web, not just *on* the web

## You must have...
- A love for writing
- An inexhaustible interest in daily news
- A steely and unshakable sense of ethics
- A genuine and friendly disposition

## Allow me to persuade you

NPR tells amazing stories, and it's our team's job to tell those stories visually. We're not a huge team, but we are an essential, growing part of the newsroom.

We’re [pushing the limits](http://apps.npr.org/tshirt/) of [online storytelling](http://apps.npr.org/wolves/), and photography is at the heart of this effort. Our new picture editor will be a leader and advocate for visual awesomeness, every day. Job perks include...

- Live music at the [Tiny Desk](http://www.npr.org/series/tiny-desk-concerts/)
- All the tote bags you can eat
- A sense of purpose
