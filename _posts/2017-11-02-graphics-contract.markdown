NPR Visuals is looking for a contract graphics editor or news apps developer to join our team in Washington, D.C., between December 2017 and April 2018, for a total of four to five months. **Apply by Friday, Nov. 17.**

Why a graphics editor OR a news apps developer? On our team, there is some overlap between these two roles, and the projects in our queue for the coming months could suit applicants from either specialty. The ideal candidate may be able to do a little of both, but specialize in design or development.

----------

## What We're Looking For

**You have strong news judgement and a sense for what makes a good visual story that serves the audience.** Moreover, you pay close attention to detail and understand the importance of nuance, precision and ethics.

**You are a team player.** You’re willing to collaborate in an open environment, working with people across the newsroom with a variety of skillsets and areas of expertise. You can explain and defend your ideas, and you are open to critique and alternative approaches. When offering feedback to colleagues, you can articulate story, design and code suggestions in a helpful and supportive way.

**You have a diverse skillset.** We build almost all of our graphics responsively, in code (HTML/CSS/JS/D3) rather than as static images, and the ideal candidate (particularly for a graphics editor role) will be strong with those core technical skills. You might also have expertise in areas like user experience design, data analysis, cartography or working with AP election results.

**You can produce quality work on deadline.** We turn around projects on time scales that run from a couple hours to a couple weeks or a couple months. You need to be able to assess what approaches will best serve a given story, what work realistically can be executed in the time available and then execute that work on time.

**You are able to start mid-to-long term projects from the MVP phase and follow through to the completed, released project.** A news apps developer might focus on the architecture of the project, developing the backend side of it and collaborating on frontend tasks as needed. A graphics editor would focus more on frontend design and interactivity.

**You consider yourself a problem solver.** You can dive into existing projects to provide maintenance and support. You can face unknown issues in unknown projects methodically, debugging until you find the cause of the issue, and implementing the best possible solution once diagnosed.

### Technical skills (news apps developer)

* **Backend:** Python, Flask, Django, Fabric, Postgresql

* **Sysadmin:** AWS cloud configuration: EC2, S3, Cloudfront, Lambda, IAM management

* **Frontend:** Javascript architecture approaches and aware of modern supporting libraries for specific project needs

* **Support:** SSH, Slack bots, etc.
