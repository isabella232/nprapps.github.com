Are you data-curious, internet savvy, and interested in journalism? Do you draw, design, or write code? We are looking for you.

We've had journalists who are learning to code, programmers who are learning about journalism, designers who love data graphics, designers who love UX, reporters who love data, and illustrators who make beautiful things.

Does this sound like you? Please join our team! It isn't always easy, but it is very rewarding. You'll learn a ton and you'll have a lot of fun.

Here are a few projects our recent interns have worked on:
