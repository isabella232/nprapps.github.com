This is not your standard photo internship!

This internship is an opportunity to learn more about the world of photo editing. Our goal isn’t to make you into a photo editor; we view this internship as a chance for you to **understand what it is like to be an editor and improve your visual literacy**, which can help you become a better photographer.

The paid internship runs from Jan. 7, 2019, to April 19, 2019. **Applications are due Monday, Oct. 29 at 12 a.m. ET.**

## What you will be doing

* **Editing:** You’ll be working closely with the Visuals Team’s photo editors (Nicole and Emily) on fast-paced deadlines -- we’re talking anywhere from 15 minutes to publication, to short-term projects that are a week out. You’ll dig into news coverage and photo research, learning how to communicate about what makes a good image across a range of news topics, including international, national, technology, arts and more.

* **Photography:** Depending on the news cycle, there may be opportunities to photograph DC-area assignments. This can mean you’d have one or two shoots in a week, or maybe just a couple shoots in a month. You’ll work closely with a radio or web reporter while out in the field, and a photo editor will go through your work and provide feedback for each assignment. There will also be a chance to work on portraiture and still lifes in our studio.

* We also encourage each intern to create a self-directed project to work on throughout the semester. It can be an [Instagram series](https://www.instagram.com/p/7-IKSkuIx5/), [video](http://www.npr.org/event/music/187282451/ok-go-a-tiny-desk-concert-in-223-takes), [photo essay](http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2014/08/16/340412191/whos-a-citizen-the-question-dividing-the-island-of-hispaniola), [text story](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/11/19/365220051/marine-corps-finds-it-tough-to-shut-down-sexist-facebook-groups) or anything in-between. You can work [independently](http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/01/23/211657513/what-sami-discovered-on-the-way-to-becoming-a-man-of-color) or with [another intern](http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/08/10/426741473/healthy-eaters-strong-minds-what-school-gardens-teach-kids) or [reporter](http://www.npr.org/2013/06/23/189202775/same-sex-couple-seeks-immigration-relief-from-high-court).

You will be part of NPR’s intern program, which includes 40-50 interns each semester, across different departments. There will be coordinated training and intern-focused programming throughout the semester, which includes meeting NPR radio hosts, career development and other opportunities. As an intern, you will be treated as a member of the team. Many NPR employees are former interns and they’re always willing to help current interns.


## Eligibility

Any student (undergraduate or graduate), or person who has graduated no more than 12 months prior to the start of the internship period to which he/she is applying is eligible. Interns must be authorized to work in the United States.

## Who should apply

We’re looking for candidates that have a strong photojournalism background. An interest in editing, or experience with video/photo editing is a nice plus. It’s also helpful if you’ve completed at least one photojournalism-focused internship prior to applying (let us know if you have!), though it’s not necessary. A **portfolio**, however, is required.

We also want folks who can tell us what they would like to accomplish during their time at NPR. **What do you want to learn? What do you want to try?** We try to shape each internship around our intern, so we rely on **you** to tell us what goals you have for your time with us!
